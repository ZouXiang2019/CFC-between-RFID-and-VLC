# CFC-between-RFID-and-VLC
fabricate the RFID tag with a PD on the tag antenna. the app flicking flashlight and the PD changes resistance with light.
this changing resistance will influence the impedance of tag antenna.
the RFID reader receive the backscatter signal which would carry this impedance.
finally, they can modulate information via flashlight and demodulate on RFID system.
